/**
 * Model-sensitive cost estimates used to order the structural steps of a [MatchPlan].
 *
 * ## What it estimates
 *
 * The planner builds a match incrementally: after *k* steps it holds a set of partial
 * matches whose expected size is `S_k`. Every candidate next step multiplies that size by a
 * **branching factor**:
 *
 * ```
 * S_k = S_{k-1} × branchingFactor(step_k)
 * ```
 *
 * and the total work of the plan is dominated by `Σ S_k`. This class estimates the
 * branching factor of each candidate from *exact counts of the current model*
 * ([ModelStatistics]) rather than from metamodel structure alone:
 *
 * - **Vertex scan of `x : C`** — `|C| × selectivity(x's constant property filters)`, where
 *   `|C|` counts `C` and all of its subclasses, because the emitted `hasLabel(...)` step
 *   admits subtypes.
 * - **Edge walk along association `A`** — the *average out-degree* `|edges(A)| / |sourceClass(A)|`,
 *   capped at 1 when the destination end has multiplicity upper bound 1.
 * - **Cycle closure** — when covering an instance makes an *additional* pattern link
 *   checkable (both endpoints covered), that check has selectivity
 *   `|edges(A)| / (|sourceClass(A)| × |targetClass(A)|)`, i.e. the probability that a given
 *   ordered vertex pair is connected by `A`. This is what makes cyclic patterns cheap and
 *   is the single most valuable estimate here.
 * - **Attribute predicates** — property constraints and where-clauses that become evaluable
 *   fall back to the classical System R constants (Selinger et al., *Access Path Selection
 *   in a Relational Database Management System*, SIGMOD 1979): `1/10` for equality, `1/3`
 *   for a range comparison, `0.9` for inequality. The engine keeps no value histograms, so
 *   nothing better is available.
 *
 * ## Relation to the literature
 *
 * Estimating branching factors from the instance model and then choosing a search plan that
 * minimises them is the *model-sensitive search plan* of Varró, Friedl & Varró (*Adaptive
 * Graph Pattern Matching for Model Transformations using Model-sensitive Search Plans*,
 * ENTCS 152, 2006), and the same idea drives the cost model of GrGen.NET (Batz, Kroll &
 * Geiß, *A First Experimental Evaluation of Search Plan Driven Graph Pattern Matching*,
 * AGTIVE 2007). Those tools compute the optimum search plan as a minimum spanning
 * arborescence (Edmonds' algorithm) over the weighted search graph; [MatchPlanBuilder]
 * instead keeps its existing greedy step-by-step selection and only replaces the *weights*,
 * which preserves all the other ordering rules the planner already implements (application
 * conditions emitted as early as possible, injective checks, variable binding order).
 *
 * ## Accuracy
 *
 * Every estimate assumes uniform distribution and independence between predicates — the
 * standard assumptions, and the standard source of error. The estimates are only ever used
 * to *order* steps, never to decide which matches exist, so an inaccurate estimate can cost
 * time but can never change a result.
 *
 * @property metamodelData Metamodel used to resolve associations and the class hierarchy.
 * @property statistics Exact cardinality snapshot of the model being matched.
 * @property nodeAnalyzer Extracts the node names referenced by an expression.
 * @property isCollectionExpression Returns `true` for collection-typed expressions, which
 *           cannot be emitted as simple vertex-property filters.
