/**
 * Cardinality statistics of a model, used by the match planner to estimate how large the
 * intermediate result of a partially built match becomes.
 *
 * The statistics are *exact counts of the model as it was when the snapshot was taken* —
 * not metamodel-derived upper bounds. They are the "model-sensitive" input that turns a
 * purely structural search-plan heuristic into a cost-based one (Varró, Friedl & Varró,
 * *Adaptive Graph Pattern Matching for Model Transformations using Model-sensitive Search
 * Plans*, ENTCS 152, 2006).
 *
 * Statistics are only ever used to *order* plan steps, never to decide which matches exist,
 * so a snapshot that lags a few vertices behind the live graph changes performance but
 * never results. Implementations may therefore cache aggressively; see
 * [GraphStatisticsCache].
