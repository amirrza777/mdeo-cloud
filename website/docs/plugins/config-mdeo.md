# Config MDEO plugin

Contributes the `search`, `solver` and `runtime` sections: which moves the search may make, which
algorithm makes them, and what resources the run may use. It also owns the executable section, so this
is the plugin that actually starts an optimisation.

## At a glance

### The `config-mdeo` language

A generated language with no extension and no editor, used the same way as
[`config-optimization`](/plugins/config-optimization#the-config-optimization-language): the config
service sends it the fragment of a `.config` file containing this plugin's sections, and it parses
them with a standalone grammar built from the same rules.

## Contribution plugins contributed

| Target language | Sections | Executable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config` | `search`, `solver`, `runtime` | `solver` |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Contribution plugin id** | `config-mdeo` |
| **Short name** | `mdeo` |
| **Grammar dependencies** | `config-optimization` |
| **Section dependencies** | `problem` from `optimization` |

The section dependency matters: before this plugin can resolve `create Annotation` or
`mutate Canvas.layers` it has to know which metamodel the problem uses. The config service therefore
computes the `problem` section first and passes its result along.

### The `search` section

The mutation operators available to the search.

```mdeo-config
search {
    mutations {
        using "./match.mt"

        create Annotation
        delete Annotation
        mutate Circle

        add Layer.shapes
        remove Layer.shapes
        mutate Canvas.layers
    }
}
```

| Entry | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `using "path.mt"` | Use a hand-written model transformation as a mutation operator |
| `create Class` | Generate an operator that adds an instance of the class |
| `delete Class` | Generate an operator that removes an instance |
| `mutate Class` | Generate an operator that changes an instance's properties |
| `add Class.edge` | Generate an operator that adds a link |
| `remove Class.edge` | Generate an operator that removes a link |
| `mutate Class.edge` | Generate an operator that rewires a link |

Entries may be mixed and repeated in any order. Generated operators are written into the result tree
as `.mt_gen` files, so you can read exactly what the search was allowed to do.

### The `solver` section

The search algorithm and when to stop. This is the **executable** section: a config file containing it
gets a run action.

```mdeo-config
solver {
    algorithm = NSGAII

    parameters {
        population = 40
        variation = mutation

        mutation {
            step = interval(1, 5)
            strategy = random
        }
    }

    termination {
        evolutions = 500
    }

    batches = 3
}
```

| Key | Values | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `algorithm` | `NSGAII`, `IBEA`, `SPEA2`, `SMSMOEA`, `VEGA`, `PESA2`, `PAES` | The multi-objective algorithm |
| `batches` | integer | Run the same configuration this many times independently |

#### `parameters`

| Key | Values | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `population` | integer | Population size |
| `variation` | `mutation`, `genetic`, `probabilistic` | How offspring are produced |
| `bisections` | integer | PESA2 / PAES only |
| `mutation { … }` | block | Mutation tuning, see below |
| `archive { size = n }` | block | PESA2 / PAES only |

#### `mutation`

| Key | Values | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `step` | `n`, `fixed`, `fixed(n)`, `interval(lo, hi)` | How many operators to apply per mutation |
| `strategy` | `random`, `repetitive` | How operators are chosen |
| `selection` | `random` | How matches are selected |
| `application` | `random` | How an operator is applied |
| `credit` | `random` | Operator credit assignment |
| `repair` | `default` | Repair strategy after a mutation |

`step = interval(1, 5)` draws uniformly from `[1, 5)` on every call; `fixed` with no argument means
one.

#### `termination`

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `evolutions` | Stop after this many generations |
| `time` | Stop after this many seconds |
| `delta` | Stop when the improvement stays below this threshold |
| `iterations` | Number of non-improving iterations tolerated before stopping |

Several conditions combine with OR — the first one to trigger ends the run.

### The `runtime` section

Execution limits.

```mdeo-config
runtime {
    timeout {
        script = 1000
        transformation = 1000
    }

    backend = MDEO

    resources {
        threads = 10
        nodes = 4
        threadsPerNode = 3
    }
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `timeout.script` | Milliseconds a single objective or constraint evaluation may take |
| `timeout.transformation` | Milliseconds a single transformation application may take |
| `backend` | `MDEO` (default) or `Tinker` — the graph representation used during search |
| `resources.threads` | Upper bound on total worker threads |
| `resources.nodes` | Upper bound on execution nodes taking part |
| `resources.threadsPerNode` | Upper bound on threads per node |

All fields are optional and act as upper bounds against what the deployment actually offers.

## Server-side capabilities

| Key | Kind | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ast` | file data | The serialised AST of the standalone language |
| `config` | request | Computes the section data for `search`, `solver` and `runtime` |
| `config-execution` | request | Starts an optimisation run |
| `config-execution-get-summary` | request | The markdown summary of a run |

Execution requests are forwarded to the `optimizer-execution` service, which is the component that
scales across nodes. See [Reading the results](/guide/results) for what comes back.
